# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
To me the most difficult part of completing the match function was making sure all the aserts were working. This comes from trying to learn and understand the new functions in pythoon, as someone who coded in java the transtion into pyhoon has been prety easy just learning how these functions work is the most challenging part, but going oover it in class has helped and now knowing some of these functions gives me a basis into how to solve certian porblems. So overall just learning he new functiosn and applying them to match asserts was the most diffucult part. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
Well i can serach a data base for a certian item and when it finds it I can see where and what. This is usefull if searching trought a massive data base as i dont have to do indisual searches or use my own eyes. Also having this base tool will aide me in the probelm solving just help in approaching the game.
